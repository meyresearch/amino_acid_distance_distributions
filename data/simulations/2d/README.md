# 2D Simulation data

This directory contains the absolute frequencies of 2D simulated amino
acid distances. The `2d_sim_*` files were generated using an algorithm, which, in addition 
to what is described in the paper, also closes circles around nodes that reach degree 6. As this 
is not part of our analytical considerations, the `2d_no_circle_*` files do not use this 
additional mechanic. These files were used in the paper.
