First, an introduction about the structure of Hb is provided, including the ensemble of tense and relaxed Hb states and the dynamic equilibrium of Hb multistate. This is followed by a brief review of Hb variants with altered Hb structure and oxygen binding properties. Finally, a review of different endogenous and exogenous allosteric effectors of Hb is presented with particular emphasis on the atomic interactions of synthetic ligands with altered allosteric function of Hb that could potentially be harnessed for the treatment of diseases.},

  abstract = {It is not merely the position of residues that is critically important for a protein's function and stability, but also their interactions. We illustrate, by using a network construction on a set of 595 nonhomologous proteins, that regular packing is preserved in short-range interactions, but short average path lengths are achieved through some long-range contacts. Thus, lying between the two extremes of regularity and randomness, residues in folded proteins are distributed according to a ``small-world'' topology. Using this topology, we show that the core residues have the same local packing arrangements irrespective of protein size. Furthermore, we find that the average shortest path lengths are highly correlated with residue fluctuations, providing a link between the spatial arrangement of the residues and protein dynamics.},

TrEMBL consists of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDSs) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, except the CDSs already included in SWISS-PROT. We also describe the Human Proteomics Initiative (HPI), a major project to annotate all known human sequences according to the quality standards of SWISS-PROT.

Although structural information is codified in the amino acid sequence, computational prediction using only this information is still an unsolved problem. However, one successful method to model a protein's structure starting from the primary sequence is to use contact prediction derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Here we use our contact predictor PconsC4 to generate a list of probable contacts between residues in the primary sequences. These contacts are then used together with the secondary structure prediction as constraints for the CONFOLD folding method. In this way, a 3D protein model can be built starting directly from the primary sequence. \textcopyright{} 2019 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The book is divided into two parts. 11 chapters are dedicated to the development of theoretical tools for the structural analysis of networks, and 7 chapters are illustrating, in a critical way, applications of these tools to real-world scenarios. The first chapters provide detailed coverage of adjacency and metric and topological properties of networks, followed by chapters devoted to the analysis of individual fragments and fragment-based global invariants in complex networks. Chapters that analyse the concepts of communicability, centrality, bipartivity, expansibility and communities in networks follow. The second part of this book is devoted to the analysis of genetic, protein residue, protein-protein interaction, intercellular, ecological and socio-economic networks, including important breakthroughs as well as examples of the misuse of structural concepts.},

With the development of deep learning, the introduction of deep learning to DTA prediction and improving the accuracy have become a focus of research. In this paper, utilizing the structural information of molecules and proteins, two graphs of drug molecules and proteins are built up respectively. Graph neural networks are introduced to obtain their representations, and a method called DGraphDTA is proposed for DTA prediction. Specifically, the protein graph is constructed based on the contact map output from the prediction method, which could predict the structural characteristics of the protein according to its sequence. It can be seen from the test of various metrics on benchmark datasets that the method proposed in this paper has strong robustness and generalizability.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

In the most recent experiment (CASP14), deep-learning methods from one research group consistently delivered computed structures rivaling the corresponding experimental ones in accuracy. In this sense, the results represent a solution to the classical protein-folding problem, at least for single proteins. The models have already been shown to be capable of providing solutions for problematic crystal structures, and there are broad implications for the rest of structural biology. Other research groups also substantially improved performance. Here, we describe these results and outline some of the many implications. Other related areas of CASP, including modeling of protein complexes, structure refinement, estimation of model accuracy, and prediction of inter-residue contacts and distances, are also described.},

Substantial progress has recently been made on this problem owing to the explosive growth in available sequences and the application of global statistical methods. In addition to three-dimensional structure, the improved understanding of covariation may help identify functional residues involved in ligand binding, protein-complex formation and conformational changes. We expect computation of covariation patterns to complement experimental structural biology in elucidating the full spectrum of protein structures, their functional interactions and evolutionary dynamics.},

We uncover the existence of nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions in ensembles of trajectories between active and inactive dynamical phases, whose nature depends on the properties of the interaction potential. We consider three potentials: two heterogeneous interaction potentials and a homogeneous G\=o potential. When preserving the full heterogeneity of interactions due to a given amino acid sequence, either in a fully interacting model or in a native contacts interacting model (heterogeneous G\=o model), the observed dynamic transitions occur between equilibrium highly native states and highly native but kinetically trapped states. A native activity is defined that allows us to distinguish these dynamic phases. In contrast, for the homogeneous G\=o model, where all native interaction energies are uniform and the amino acid sequence plays no role, the dynamical transition is a direct consequence of the static bistability between the unfolded and the native state. In the two heterogeneous interaction models the native-active and native-inactive states, despite their thermodynamic similarity, have widely varying dynamical properties, and the transition between them occurs even in lattice proteins whose sequences are designed to make them optimal folders.},

  abstract = {The extent to which the contemporary dataset of protein structures can be segregated into four structural ``classes'' as originally defined by Levitt \& Chothia in 1976 is examined and a simple method presented for the assignment of protein domains into these classes. Assignments are based on known three-dimensional structures, and for successful assignment it was found that helix/sheet content, contacts between secondary structures and their sequential order had to be used. The procedure attempts to maximise the automatic separation into classes for a dataset of 197 manually classified, non-homologous domains. It was found that approximately 90\%of the structures were classified automatically; the remainder were borderline and were left for manual inspection. The method was then applied to a test set of 43 protein domains with similar results. The data support the concept of distinct classes of protein structure, although a few intermediate structures are found, demonstrating that it is possible to define relatively simple parameters complying with commonly accepted nomenclature that automatically define 90\% of protein domains with essentially 100\% accuracy. However, re-examination of the data also suggested that the previously separate {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} and {$\alpha$}+ {$\beta$} classes show considerable overlap and are more naturally represented as a single {$\alpha\beta$} class. This large {$\alpha\beta$} class can then be most easily subdivided by consideration of whether the sheets are mainly parallel, antiparallel or mixed. The correlation between structural class and function is discussed, together with the conservation of class within a sequence superfamily. This represents the first step in an automated phenetic description of protein structure complementing the usual phylogenetic approach to protein structure classification.},

  abstract = {Rhodopsins are photoreceptive membrane proteins consisting of a common heptahelical transmembrane architecture that contains a retinal chromophore. Rhodopsin was first discovered in the animal retina in 1876, but a different type of rhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin, was reported to be present in the cell membrane of an extreme halophilic archaeon, Halobacterium salinarum, 95\hspace{0.25em}years later. Although these findings were made by physiological observation of pigmented tissue and cell bodies, recent progress in genomic and metagenomic analyses has revealed that there are more than 10,000 microbial rhodopsins and 9000 animal rhodopsins with large diversity and tremendous new functionality. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster, we provide an overview of the diversity of functions, structures, color discrimination mechanisms and optogenetic applications of these two rhodopsin families, and will also highlight the third distinctive rhodopsin family, heliorhodopsin.},

  abstract = {The protein folding problem was first articulated as question of how order arose from disorder in proteins: How did the various native structures of proteins arise from interatomic driving forces encoded within their amino acid sequences, and how did they fold so fast? These matters have now been largely resolved by theory and statistical mechanics combined with experiments. There are general principles. Chain randomness is overcome by solvation-based codes. And in the needle-in-a-haystack metaphor, native states are found efficiently because protein haystacks (conformational ensembles) are funnel-shaped. Order-disorder theory has now grown to encompass a large swath of protein physical science across biology.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised protein language models trained across millions of diverse sequences learn structure and function of proteins. Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evo lutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.},

  abstract = {In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},
