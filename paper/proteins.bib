  abstract = {This chapter reviews how allosteric (heterotrophic) effectors and natural mutations impact hemoglobin (Hb) primary physiological function of oxygen binding and transport. First, an introduction about the structure of Hb is provided, including the ensemble of tense and relaxed Hb states and the dynamic equilibrium of Hb multistate. This is followed by a brief review of Hb variants with altered Hb structure and oxygen binding properties. Finally, a review of different endogenous and exogenous allosteric effectors of Hb is presented with particular emphasis on the atomic interactions of synthetic ligands with altered allosteric function of Hb that could potentially be harnessed for the treatment of diseases.},

  abstract = {In spite of the fact that there has been a significant increase in the number of solved protein structures, structural information is missing for many proteins. Although structural information is codified in the amino acid sequence, computational prediction using only this information is still an unsolved problem. However, one successful method to model a protein's structure starting from the primary sequence is to use contact prediction derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Here we use our contact predictor PconsC4 to generate a list of probable contacts between residues in the primary sequences. These contacts are then used together with the secondary structure prediction as constraints for the CONFOLD folding method. In this way, a 3D protein model can be built starting directly from the primary sequence. \textcopyright{} 2019 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The first chapters provide detailed coverage of adjacency and metric and topological properties of networks, followed by chapters devoted to the analysis of individual fragments and fragment-based global invariants in complex networks. Chapters that analyse the concepts of communicability, centrality, bipartivity, expansibility and communities in networks follow. The second part of this book is devoted to the analysis of genetic, protein residue, protein-protein interaction, intercellular, ecological and socio-economic networks, including important breakthroughs as well as examples of the misuse of structural concepts.},

Drug\textendash target affinity (DTA) prediction is the most important step of computer-aided drug design, which could speed up drug development and reduce resource consumption. With the development of deep learning, the introduction of deep learning to DTA prediction and improving the accuracy have become a focus of research. In this paper, utilizing the structural information of molecules and proteins, two graphs of drug molecules and proteins are built up respectively. Graph neural networks are introduced to obtain their representations, and a method called DGraphDTA is proposed for DTA prediction. Specifically, the protein graph is constructed based on the contact map output from the prediction method, which could predict the structural characteristics of the protein according to its sequence. It can be seen from the test of various metrics on benchmark datasets that the method proposed in this paper has strong robustness and generalizability.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Core components are rigorous blind testing of methods and evaluation of the results by independent assessors. In the most recent experiment (CASP14), deep-learning methods from one research group consistently delivered computed structures rivaling the corresponding experimental ones in accuracy. In this sense, the results represent a solution to the classical protein-folding problem, at least for single proteins. The models have already been shown to be capable of providing solutions for problematic crystal structures, and there are broad implications for the rest of structural biology. Other research groups also substantially improved performance. Here, we describe these results and outline some of the many implications. Other related areas of CASP, including modeling of protein complexes, structure refinement, estimation of model accuracy, and prediction of inter-residue contacts and distances, are also described.},

We uncover the existence of nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions in ensembles of trajectories between active and inactive dynamical phases, whose nature depends on the properties of the interaction potential. We consider three potentials: two heterogeneous interaction potentials and a homogeneous G\=o potential. When preserving the full heterogeneity of interactions due to a given amino acid sequence, either in a fully interacting model or in a native contacts interacting model (heterogeneous G\=o model), the observed dynamic transitions occur between equilibrium highly native states and highly native but kinetically trapped states. A native activity is defined that allows us to distinguish these dynamic phases. In contrast, for the homogeneous G\=o model, where all native interaction energies are uniform and the amino acid sequence plays no role, the dynamical transition is a direct consequence of the static bistability between the unfolded and the native state. In the two heterogeneous interaction models the native-active and native-inactive states, despite their thermodynamic similarity, have widely varying dynamical properties, and the transition between them occurs even in lattice proteins whose sequences are designed to make them optimal folders.},

Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evo lutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.},

  abstract = {In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},
